1) Describe any design decisions you made. These may be minimal for Lab 1
	In the Catalog, I decide to use three fields to represent all the information in the catalog, and these three list is corresponding to each other instead of 	creating a new class to include all these three fields.
	In the BufferPool, I decide to use a list of Page to store all the pages in the bufferPool
	I create my own HeapFileIterator class that is used by the iterator() method from the HeapFile
	For the whole flow of the simple database, I follow the instruction from the lecture(who calls whom).
	I followed all other design decisions according to spec requirement. 

2) Discuss and justify any changes you made to the API
	I implement the methods required following the spec and javadoc. 
	Nothing changes for the given API besides the classes that required to implement.
	
3) Describe any missing or incomplete elements of your code
	Nothing as far as I know. 

4) Describe how long you spent on the lab, and whether there was anything you found particularly difficult or confusing
  	I spent about 15 hours for the lab, and one thing I found was particular difficult is that the constructor for the heap file. Since first it is hard to think up to transforming File to the byte[] (this part took me a lot of times, maybe several hours) and second I have never done anything related to transfer File to a byte[].
